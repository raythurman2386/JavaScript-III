/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. When this is used in the global scope it points to the window.

* 2. Implicit Binding points to the object left of the dot.

* 3. New Binding, when a constructor is used, this points to the specific instance of the object that is to be returned by the constructor

* 4. Explicit Binding this is explicitly defined when javascripts call or apply methods are used.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
